4. Edit Copy targets
   The build will automatically copy the relevant files to your homeassistant config directory. Edit targets to your needs:
   ```
   targets: [
      { src: 'src/*', dest: '/Volumes/dockerfiles/configs/hass-config/www/custom_ui/src' },
      { src: 'dist/*', dest: '/Volumes/dockerfiles/configs/hass-config/www/custom_ui/dist' }
    ]
    ```
   
6. Build

    Run `npm install` once before first build.

   * `npm run build` produces debug version of the code (just bundled but no crunched)
   * `npm run release` produces crunched bundle

    The output files are located in `dist` directory.

    Note: The style.ts file is auto-generated
    
7. Add Card to your configuration 
   ```yaml
     - url: /local/custom_ui/ha-webuntis-card.js
